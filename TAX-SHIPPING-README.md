## Implementation Details

### Database Tables

**Tax Rates Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE tax_rates (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  state VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  rate DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
  is_active TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE KEY country_state (country, state)
);
```

**Shipping Methods Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE shipping_methods (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  base_cost DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  estimated_days INT NOT NULL,
  is_active TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### API Endpoints

**Tax Rate Endpoints**
- `GET /api/tax-rates` - Get tax rate for a specific country/state

- `POST /api/admin/tax-rates` - Create a new tax rate (admin only)
- `PUT /api/admin/tax-rates/:id` - Update a tax rate (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/tax-rates/:id` - Delete a tax rate (admin only)

**Shipping Method Endpoints**

- `PUT /api/admin/shipping-methods/:id` - Update a shipping method (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/admin/shipping-methods/:id` - Delete a shipping method (admin only)

## Usage

### Admin Configuration

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Navigate to Tax Rates or Shipping in the admin menu
3. Configure rates and methods as needed

### Setting Default Values

It's recommended to set up at least:

- At least one shipping method

## Calculation Logic

The total price calculation follows this logic:
1. Calculate the subtotal (sum of item prices Ã— quantities)
2. Add the shipping cost based on the selected method
3. Calculate tax based on the applicable rate for the shipping location
4. Sum all amounts to get the final total
